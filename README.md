# Restaurant Simulation

A multithreaded Java simulation of a restaurant, built to demonstrate **advanced Java features**, **concurrency**, and **clean code practices**.  
This project serves as a portfolio example to showcase my coding style, problem-solving approach, and use of modern Java.  

---

## Features
- Modular design (`model`, `service`, `payment`, `util`)  
- Concurrency with multiple cooks (threads) and an order queue (BlockingQueue)  
- Reporting with modern String API methods (Java 11+)  
- Unit testing with JUnit 5  
- Exploration of advanced Java language features  

---

## Code Example
```java
// Example: printing a daily report using CompletableFutures
Restaurant restaurant = new Restaurant();
restaurant.start();
restaurant.printReport();
```

## Advanced Java Features

### Generics
- Wildcards (`?`), upper/lower bounds (`extends`, `super`)  
- PECS principle (*Producer Extends, Consumer Super*)  

### Streams
- **Intermediate operations**: `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, `distinct`, `sorted`  
- **Terminal operations**: `forEach`, `collect`, `reduce`, `count`  
- **Optional results**: `findFirst`, `findAny`, `max`, `min`  
- **Parallel streams**: parallel processing for performance, trade-offs with overhead  

### Functional Interfaces
- **Core**:
  - `Consumer<T>` â†’ performs an action, no return  
  - `Supplier<T>` â†’ lazy object creation  
  - `Predicate<T>` â†’ boolean test  
  - `Function<T,R>` â†’ maps input to output  
  - `BiConsumer<T,U>` â†’ action with two inputs (e.g., `(Order, Message)` logging)  
- **Custom**:
  - `TriConsumer<T,U,V>` â†’ extended interface with three arguments, implemented in Toolkit  
- **Method References**:
  - Concise syntax for lambdas, e.g. `System.out::println`  

### Java Module System (since Java 9)
- `module-info.java` used to control visibility of packages  
- Demonstrates encapsulation and explicit dependencies  

---

## Concurrency & Multithreading

### Thread Types
- Difference between `Thread`, `Runnable`, `Callable`, `ExecutorService`  
- Executors used to manage worker threads (cooks)  

### Task Processing
- **BlockingQueue**: thread-safe order queue between waiters and cooks  
- **Callable & Future**: asynchronous tasks with return values (e.g., preparation duration)  
- **CompletableFuture**: async composition and reporting  
- **Parallel Streams**: declarative parallelism, when suitable  

---

## Synchronization & Thread Safety
- Compared **`synchronized` vs. atomic classes**: trade-off between safety and throughput  
- Evaluated `Collections.synchronizedList` and `AtomicInteger`  
- Replaced with design choices avoiding shared mutable state where possible  
- Key insight: **better to design for immutability and handover (BlockingQueue)** than rely on synchronization  

---

## Lessons Learned
- Explored `AtomicInteger` and `Collections.synchronizedList` but replaced with simpler, cleaner solutions  
- Recognized that `synchronized` ensures correctness but can hurt performance under contention  
- Prefer designing thread-safe handover (queues) instead of manual locking  

---

## Best Practices & Organization
- Static final constants â†’ `UPPER_CASE`  
- Functional fields â†’ `camelCase`  
- Toolkit class for reusable `Consumer`, `Predicate`, `TriConsumer` utilities  
- `import static` for concise access to functional helpers  
- Modular organization with clear separation of concerns
